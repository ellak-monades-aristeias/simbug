## Simulation Business Game Framework
#### An Open source project

SIMBUG is an acronym for a Simulation Business Game. It is addressed to serious or applied games, i.e. games designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment and are used to enhance learning in business education. 
SIMBUG aims to relieve educators from the burden of possessing several computing and programming skills in order to create a "serious game". Using SIMBUG they will be free to focus on their education goal and any corresponding pedagogical design principles.
SIMBUG is built upon a "serious game model", i.e. an abstract conceptualization of what any serious game has in common and its software infrastructure is based on the so called 3-tier architecture.
SIMBUG is addressed initially to the educational gaming open source community, calling for common action for creating an open standard for serious and business games.

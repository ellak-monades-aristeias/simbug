# SIMBUG, Simulation Business Game Framework

##What is SIMBUG
A SIMBUG is an acronym for a *Simulation Business Game*. SIMBUG is related to **serious or applied games**, i.e. games designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment and are used to enhance learning in business education.

More specifically, SIMBUG will include an open standard and a server implementation aiming at providing an easy way for educators to setup a simulation business game. Those two components of SIMBUG focus on the "business logic" and "data storage" layers (of the [three-tier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture)) and leave the implementation of the "presentation layer" to the educator side. 

In order to do so, an [open standard](https://github.com/dkremmydas/simbug/blob/master/SIMBUG%20open%20standard.md) will be made publicly available and an open source JAVA RESTful server will be crafted

##Acknowledgments
This repository is about an [ELLAAK](https://ellak.gr/) funded project aiming at developing an open standard for computerized simulation business games (SIMBUG).
The project is consisted of three work packages

1. Compiling a computerized business games open standard
2. Developing a RESTful server that serves SIMBUGs, following the developed standard
3. Writing a proof-of-concept game that rests in a client machine and communicates with the server

# SIMBUG, Simulation Business Game Framework

##What is SIMBUG
A SIMBUG is an acronym for a *Simulation Business Game*. SIMBUG is related to **serious or applied games**, i.e. games designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment and are used to enhance learning in business education.

More specifically, SIMBUG will include an open standard and a server implementation aiming at providing an easy way for educators to setup a simulation business game. Those two components of SIMBUG focus on the "business logic" and "data storage" layers (of the [three-tier architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture)) and leave the implementation of the "presentation layer" to the educator side. 

##Motivation and Objective
Creating a simulation business game shoudl follow several design principles. Furthermore several computing and programming skills are necessary. We want to seperate those two concerns and give the ability to educators all over the world to focus on their main skill, i.e designing the game. 

In order to do so, we have setup a 

In order to do so, an [open standard](https://github.com/dkremmydas/simbug/blob/master/SIMBUG%20open%20standard.md) will be made publicly available and an open source JAVA RESTful server will be crafted


##Acknowledgments
SIMBUG was initiated by an [ELLAAK](https://ellak.gr/) funded project. The original project was consisted of three work-packages

1. Compiling a computerized business games open standard
2. Developing a RESTful server that serves SIMBUGs, following the developed standard
3. Writing a proof-of-concept game that rests in a client machine and communicates with the server

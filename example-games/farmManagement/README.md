A farm management game with many players

The game is splited in two phases: 
Phase 1 is where players deide on the land to rent out (to other players) or in from other players.
Phase 2 is where players decide on crop plans (common wheat, durum wheat, maize, cotton -all on low or high intensity)

Cultivating a crop incurres costs and produce income.
Costs are fixed for each crop. Low intensity is a fraction of high intensity and also brings a fraction of the yield.

Yields are subject to uncertainty.

Price is determined by demand and by the all-players supply. Demand is also subject to uncertainty but demand of period(t+1) is somehow related to demand of period(t).

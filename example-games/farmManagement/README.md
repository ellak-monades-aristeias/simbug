A farm management game with many players incorporating yield and price risk. 

The game is splited in two phases: 
Phase 1 is where players decide on the land to rent out (to other players) or in from other players.
Phase 2 is where players decide on crop plans (common wheat, durum wheat, maize, cotton -all on low or high intensity)

Cultivating a crop incures a priori known costs and potentially produce (unknown) income (equals price times yield times cultivated area). 
Crop cultivations is split between a low and a high intensity mode. Low intensity has lower costs and lower yields.

Yields are subject to uncertainty. There are three different possible states of yields (low, normal, high) corresponding to more or less favourable biophysical and agronomic conditions. There is also an a priori known state-of-yields and crop-intensity modes to yields payoff matrix. 

Price is determined by demand and by the total players supply. Demand is also subject to uncertainty but demand of period(t+1) is related to demand of period(t).
